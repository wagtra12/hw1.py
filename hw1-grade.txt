For number 1 it would be easier to assign variables   such as 
a = 1
b = -5.86
c = 8.5408
That way you don’t have to worry about miss typing numbers like -5.86 as 5.86
 That way you can reuse the code for other things
For number 2 awesome ideas for the import saved you from a lot of unnecessary typing.
